# 📩 SMS Spam Detection

## 📌 Description
A simple machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam) using text preprocessing and classification algorithms like **Naive Bayes**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Load and clean the SMS dataset.
2. Preprocess text (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.)
3. Vectorize using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4. Train model (Naive Bayes).
5. Predict and evaluate accuracy.

## 📂 Files Included
- `sms_spam_detection.ipynb` – Full code and output in Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Use
Just open the notebook in Google Colab and run the cells to train and test the model.
